## Description

This application will allow the user to roll virtual dice with the tap of a button. The user will be able to select how many dice, between 1 and 10; how many sides: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20; and will have the option of rolling a standard 7-dice DnD set together ... because of course you want to see that!
